[h1]FAQ[/h1]

[b]My pop's happiness is capped, help![/b]

The synthetics get a slight boost to habitability (increases with tech) but are otherwise still subject to habitability happiness caps.

Make sure when you build colony ships you don't use non-fully grown pops (indicated by the lack of traits) and use your dominant species instead (indicated by a green/blue border).

[b]I just started and can't build any pops![/b]

Make sure you selected the Synthetic trait when creating your species.

Also, make sure you don't have any other robot-modifying mod (such as [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=717991043]Build Robots Quicker[/url]).

[b]Some of my traits aren't copying![/b]

Due to limitations on the mod API, the trait support has to be hand-managed so only a few are supported.

The following traits are currently supported:
[list]
[*] Vanilla traits
[*] Extended traits
[*] Awakening
[/list]

Additionally, the copying occurs after pops finish building. While they're in progress, they won't have the traits but don't worry they will.

If the indices are different, there's a problem. If they're the same, there shouldn't be any problems.
