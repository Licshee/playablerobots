* *Cookiemonster364's* fix for trait copying

* Fix initial pops not being the same race and new pops (fix for xenophobic ethic and repugnant trait)

* Improve the game start tile modification a bit. Was: replace farms and power plant lvl 1 with power plant lvl 2. Now: replace farms with power plant lvl 1 & replace base tile food with energy.
* Select synthetic playstyle by selecting the trait in species creation instead of as a window on game start.
